the speaker that we are using is connected to the pi via analog
im using alsamixer that is already pre installed in our pi

1. change the sound card to the analog's
$ alsamixer
$ f6
$ pick analog

2. the speaker volume is way too soft and u can barely hear at 100%, so lets bump it up
(remember to do ur apt-get update/upgrade)
(best to reboot after all these)
$ sudo apt-get install pulseaudio pavucontrol
$ pact1 list | grep 'Sink'
above command list ur sound interfaces, it should be '1' for your analog interface by default
$ pactl -- set-sink-volume 1 +200%
replace '1' with number of your choice if necessary

3. test sound
to test the sound you can play some wav files that should already exist in your pi
$ aplay /usr/share/scratch/Media/Sounds/Vocals/Singer2.wav

4. get it to say stuff
for this we will be using espeak
$ sudo apt-get install espeak
$ espeal "aaaaaa hello world" 2>/dev/null
